unprepared for such intense and lengthy request for ICU beds, professionals, personal protection equipment and healthcare resources.\nBrazil recorded first COVID-19 case on February 26 and reached community transmission on March 20.\n\n# Call to action\n\nThere is urgency in obtaining accurate that to better predict and prepare healthcare systems and avoid collapse, defined by above capacity need of ICU beds (assuming human resources, PPE and professionals are available), using individual clinical data - in lieu of epidemiological and populational data.\n![](https://img.medscape.com/thumbnail_library/cdc_200313_flatten_the_curve_800x450.jpg)\n\n## Task 01\n**Predict admission to the ICU of confirmed COVID-19 cases.**\nBased on the data available, is it feasible to predict which patients will need intensive care unit support?\nThe aim is to provide tertiary and quarternary hospitals with the most accurate answer, so ICU resources can be arranged or patient transfer can be scheduled.\n\n## Task 02\n**Predict NOT admission to the ICU of confirmed COVID-19 cases.**\nBased on the subsample of widely available data, is it feasible to predict which patients will need intensive care unit support?\nThe aim is to provide local and temporary hospitals a good enough answer, so frontline physicians can safely discharge and remotely follow up with these patients.\n\n# The Data\n\n## Label output\n\nICU should be considered, as the first version of this dataset, the target variable.\n\n## Window Concept\n\nWe were carefull to include real life cenarios of with window of events and available data.\nData was obtain and grouped\n- patient\n-- patient encounter\n-- aggregated by windows in chronological order\n| Window   | Description                         |\n|----------|-------------------------------------|\n| 0-2      | From 0 to 2 hours of the admission  |\n| 2-4      | From 2 to 4 hours of the admission  |\n| 4-6      | From 4 to 6 hours of the admission  |\n| 6-12     | From 6 to 12 hours of the admission |\n| Above-12 | Above 12 hours from admission       |\n\n\n* Beware NOT to use the data when the target variable is present, as it is unknown the order of the event (maybe the target event happened before the results were obtained). They were kept there so we can grow this dataset in other outcomes latter on.\n\nExamples:\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F1591620%2Fb1bc424df771a4d2d3b3088606d083e6%2FTimeline%20Example%20Best.png?generation=1594740856017996\u0026alt=media)\n\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F1591620%2F77ca2b4635bc4dd7800e1c777fed9de1%2FTimeline%20Example%20No.png?generation=1594740873237462\u0026alt=media)\n\n\n## Dataset\n\nThis dataset contains anonymized data from Hospital S\u00EDrio-Liban\u00EAs, S\u00E3o Paulo and Brasilia. All data were anonymized following the best international practices and recommendations. \nData has been cleaned and scaled by column according to Min Max Scaler to fit between -1 and 1.\n\n\n## Available data\n1. Patient demographic information          (03)\n2. Patient previous grouped diseases      (09)\n3. Blood results                                          (36)\n4. Vital signs                                               (06)\n\nIn total there are 54 features, expanded when pertinent to the mean, median, max, min, diff and relative diff.\n\n1. diff = max - min\n2. relative diff = diff/median\n\n# Expected submission\n\nSubmit a notebook that implements the full lifecycle of data preparation, model creation and evaluation. \n\n# Questions and information\n\nPlease use the kernels and the discussion, as S\u00EDrio-Liban\u00EAs Data Intelligence Team will be replying to questions.\nAdditional questions, corporate and clarifications: data.intelligence@hsl.org.br\n\n# Selected Interesting Kernel\n\nInteresting solutions made public within this dataset competition will be invited to discuss and present their findings and approach to a group of researchers and experts in field along with the data science team of S\u00EDrio-Liban\u00EAs. \n\n## FAQ\n\n### Data Sharing and Usage\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F1591620%2Fa6d09844fc8030e0f06f03e0c9e6c76d%2FLicence.png?generation=1587074246329486\u0026alt=media)\n\n## Tips \u0026 Tricks\n\n### Missing data\n\n*Problem:* One of the major challenges of working with health care data is that the sampling rate varies across different type of measurements. For instance, vital signs are sampled more frequently (usually hourly) than blood labs (usually daily).\n\n*Tips \u0026 Tricks:* It is reasonable to assume that a patient who does not have a measurement recorded in a time window is clinically stable, potentially presenting vital signs and blood labs similar to neighboring windows. Therefore, one may fill the missing values using the next or previous entry. Attention to multicollinearity and zero variance issues in this data when choosing your algorithm.\n\n### The earlier, the better!\n\n*Problem:* Early identification of those patients who will develop an adverse course of illness (and need intensive care) is a key for an appropriate treatment (saving lives) and to managing beds and resources.\n\n*Tips \u0026 Tricks:* Whereas a predictive model using all time windows will probably yield a greater accuracy, a nice model using only the first (0-2) is likely  to be more clinically relevant. The creativity is very welcome though, please feel free with feature engineering and time windows. Attention to repeated measures on individuals once these values are (positively) correlated when playing around with data.\n\n\n# Acknowledgement \n\nSociedade Beneficiente de Senhoras S\u00EDrio-Liban\u00EAs is commited to philanthropy and science to deliver better health outcomes to those in need.
